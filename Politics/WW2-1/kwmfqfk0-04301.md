# Beginning
In the aftermath of WW1, the Treaty of Versailles enacted 5 main terms

1. The surrender of all German colonies as League of Nations mandates and the exclusion of Germany from the League.
2. The Rhineland had to be demilitarised with the maximum size of the standing army set and reduced to 100,000 men. It could also only posses 6 battleships with no submarines and no air force.
3. Germany had to make substantial territorial concessions and was was forbidden to unite with Austria
4. Germany had to pay 31.4B$ reparations and give away significant resources to other people which was known to be the cause of the eventual destruction of the German army
5. Germany in the â€˜War Guilt Clause' had to accept blame for starting WW1.

This was devastating news for Germany since they were economically destroyed and the heavily pride Germans were now being berated. How could such a powerful nation have lost? Why were they to give land to lesser nations?

The provisions seemed draconian to the germans. So among these people rose a man from ranks of the military and gave Germans a reason to feel pride again. One who would take back the fatherland. One who would restore old Glory. *Adolf Hitler*.

## Rise
Hitler started slowly flouting the treaty and testing the allies slowly building up his army and marching troops into neighbouring lands which were supposedly German. After taking back the lost land he was to expand has seemed natural to him in the east to defeat Bolshevism.

Hitler brazenly marches into Australia and is welcomed with open hands. The allies and Austrians do nothing. Subsequently on declaration of intention to take over Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain attempts to negotiate with him to prevent significant moves. We know how that went.

Stalin and Hitler internally agree to divide Poland amongst themselves and to leave each other in peace. The Allies on the other hand had sworn that should Hitler so much as touch Poland they will declare war. 3 September 1939 France and Britain true to their word Declare war on Germany starting the Phoney War.

## Phoney War
It took Hitler 20 days to actually even win Poland who while not very advanced had a strong willed army. Despite being poorly equipped the results made it obvious that they cannot fight Britain and France together. France then being the most well equipped and well trained army in the world.

At this point however while Hitler figured out what to do France didn't do shit. They just decided to sit and wait it out with their confidence in the Maginot line on the Franco-German border which was put in place to prevent any more bloodshed as in the WW1.

### Planned Failure
Hitler's generals however didn't want to fight France alltogether therefore they designed a plan from the WW1 playbook designed to fail. Goering suggested invading Belgium & Holland then northern France. Hitler didn't like this and still wanted to fight.

### Manstien Plan
Eric Manstien an ambitious general decides however to fight and comes up with an idea to rip through the french border dividing it from the inside by taking advantage of the confusion and chaos created by high speed.

With the Manstien plan shelved, on 9 April 1940 hitler invades Norway and Denmark to secure Iron and also alerting the British. The poor british resistance in Norway was quickly taken care of by the newfound German power of the Luftwaffe and their Stuka dive bombers fully securing the countries by May 1940. On 10th May 1940 Neville Chamberlain resigns after the Norway debacle thus putting and end to the Phoney War. He is replaced by Warmonger Winston Churchill.

## Fall of Western Front
Hitler quickly takes over Belgium and Holland in intention to grab ports to attack Britain. Recon planes to france report a massive traffic jam of tanks outside ardennes stretching back for kilometers into Germany. This report was not believed since the French were convinced that Hitler is focused on taking Belgium and Holland to invade britain. And so on a smartly chosen moment. Germany unleashes Blitzkrieg.

They were able to make up for their inferior military with time, speed and surprise encircling the entire British and French army in Belgium and cutting them off. Had the french believed their recon Germany would have been at their mercy.

The Germans now in france are able to overwhelm the french army who had been trained for the grind of WW1 and not the high speed barrage of WW2. Their morally is dipped by the loud german planes and the whistling bombs all of which are coming in non stop waves. The french at this point are furthur disadvantaged since they have very poor comms and rely on field telephone lines which get cut by bombs and dispatch rider which get slowed by refugees. The germans tanks on the other hand each come standard with Radio by default.

What france did not know was that Germany which they expected to reach Sedan in 2 weeks would be there in 3 days thanks to Pervitin chemically made of methamphetamine. Also known as Crystal Meth. Meth made the soldiers immune to empathy, over energised and boosted morale. With no regard for consequences, the supermen soldiers for the first time ever didn't have to sleep at night and could go on for 3 days and 3 nights non stop.

Blitzkrieg was a combination of overwhelming air superiority, super fast tanks, up to the minute communications. And a tireless and fearless army.

### Guderian Wins
Just 10 days after starting from germany, on 20th May 1940 Heinz Guderian reaches the atlantic coast. The British Expeditionary Force is now completely stranded in a small channel between Rotterdam and Calais. The british have now only one way to escape. By Sea.

The british send 3 battleships to Calais to rescue but are annihilated by the germans. 1 million British and French troops are now stuck in Belgium. After massive flouting of authority however, Hitler in a controversial move orders everyone to stop. Hermann Goering has convinced him to give the "honour" of obliterating the BEF to the Air Force with bombs and not the army.

## Dunkirk
To the luck of britain the skies mostly stayed covered during the luftwaffe and the made dive bombing easier. Further by the fact that even a massive destroyer carrying 1000s of people from 6000 feet looks like a pencil which is wobbling. The luftwaffe however have to deal with something much much worse yet to come. The Supermarine Spitfire. The germans lost 240 planes and the british 170. But despite this loss the evacuation was successful.

The Churchill requests the public for assistance and with his best hopes he hoped to bring back 45000 people. Civilians risked their life and limb to travel accross the channel and help the Royal Navy in bringing back people. People and Navy with assistance from the RAF were able to bring back more than 340,000 people. Thus giving rise to: The British Dunkirk Spirit.

## Fall of France
With Dunkirk lost hitler moves to france. Realising that Paris has architechtural jewels, the french decide it will be better to evacuate the city and declare open for the germans to come and take as the government moves to Bordeaux.

On June 14, 1940 The Nazi Flag is now on The Eiffel Tower. In WW1 the treaty was signed in a railway carriage in Paris. Hitler now stages a HUGE public propaganda campaign where he takes the same carriage where the first treaty was signed out of the museum and puts it back to the same place and this time the French are negotiating for armistice and will be paraded back in shame under the Swastika Flag.

Hitler then proceeds to take the carriage back to Germany and destroys the location of the signing of the treaty signalling to germany. That we were not defeated in WW1. We have won. We have won the combination of the WW1 and WW2. Hitler the greatest war machine since Alexander the Great has restored it old glory to the fatherland.
