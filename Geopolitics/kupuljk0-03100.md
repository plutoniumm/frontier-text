Taiwan currently is advocating for almost independence from china. It is internationally not defined if they are two or one country. China has a One China Principle which makes them say Taiwan is a chinese territory.

## Brief History of Taiwan
Taiwan was first held by indigenous people then by the Dutch, briefly the Spanish and finally the Xing dynasty who held it for about 200 years. It was then taken over by Japan and ruled with an Iron Fist pre WW2 after which it was given back to China to govern.

At this same time China was under civil war by Chiang-Kai Shek with the nationalist government and spoiler alert the winner, Chairman Mao with his Communist Govt. Chiang Shek then fled to Taiwan with 2 million people and soldiers and ruled in exile. At that time there were TECHNICALLY TWO Chinese govts. The western world naturally was very invested in recognising Taiwan as true China against Communism.

While at the time people may want to see Chiang Shek as the good guy, he ruled Taiwan with a heavily authoritarian system and executed, imprisoned and tortured anyone who was remotely Anti-Govt. It was a brief era called the White Terror where millions were killed. As soon as Shek died however the country by the 80s quickly transitioned to a democracy and in 2020 was the fastest growing economy as well as a key player in the semiconductors industry.

## Two parties
China currently has two large systems. While with great difficulty, they have largely succeeded in creating a free democracy. Most of the country (~65%) either likes or would like to stay with the status quo, as has been for last 20 years. The rest of the 25-30% however has been consistently shifting slowly from united to independent taiwan as younger generations come in.

**Blues**: These people want strong economic relations with china and think of them as business partners, they think staying engaged with china is beneficial to them. The largest party here is Kuomintang (KMT)
**Green**: These people are strongly against any dealing with china and believe that large dependency on china is not good for the country. These people like the name Taiwan as opposed to ROC. The largest party here is Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The greens largely already consider Taiwan as independent.

### Radicals
It is often taken as a misconception that blues and greens want what their respective radicals actually want. Note that Radical Blues are not Extreme blues, they are a different class altogether. The NORMAL blues and greens are much more in favour of the status quo as opposed to the radicals, somewhat like how Norway has center right and center left parties but probably no radicals.

**Deep Blues**: These people want a full unification with china
**Deep Green**: These people want a full independence from china

## USA
The United States has officially never made their stand on this clear. They have usually stayed in the grey area. They say they don't officially support independence but never that they support unification. USA cannot really advocate for full independence as that can be seen as a sign of political agression, nor can they publicly oppose the process of democracy. Therefore they have always been vague.

Taiwan is currently in limbo. They can enjoy independence only so long as they don't openly claim so. The USA has also passed a legislation which losely says that they will defend taiwan against attacks to any self determination by other than peaceful means except from China. *TF does that even mean...?*

## China
China is very strict about their media presence, when John Cena said, "Taiwan will be the first country to watch F9", he was forced to publicly apologize for calling Taiwan a country. China even forced Top Gun: Maverick to remove the Taiwanese flag from their trailer where it was featured as a part of an ensemble of flags on a jacket.

China recently themselves sent 150 defence aircrafts into Taiwan's airspace as a partial sign of agression after Xi Jingping declared that China will undergo a full reunification. China has also forced Taiwan to compete in the olympics not as Taiwan but as Chinese Taipei since the 80s. This is a compromise they made with the IOC to compete independent of china by not anger them at the same time.

While with USA in the middle China and Taiwan have been at relative peace, in recent years china has started becoming more and more aggressive. In a large scale conflict even with American weaponary and maybe even their support, due to Geography it is UNLIKELY (but not impossible) that Taiwan can withstand an attack from China because of sheer brute force. However due to trade and other things like the semiconductor industry it is POSSIBLE that in event of a full scale War, other countries might step in and take sides.
