The collapse of the Soviet Union marked the end of Soviet-style communism & the cold war. It created over a dozen new democracies in EurAsia. Yet today, this event is taught very little in most schools including the Eastern Bloc.

> everything is rotten, it must be changed ~ Gorbachev's Foreign Minister

## What was the Soviet Union
The USSR was a 'dream' of a communist utopia where every person works towards the greater good where people would live at an unprecedented level of prosperity. A dream of peace and freedom. Yet it never even came close to that dream. When measured against the ideals the Soviet Union set for itself, it was an utter failure.

It ended up being incredibly an inefficient slowed down by an extreme level of bureaucracy. It one of the most repressive police states ever created that butchered more than 10M of its own citizens and starved another 20M.

After the Bolchevik revolution & the abolition of the class system from the Russian Empire. Rather than becoming the dream, The USSR became an extreme dictatorship under Lenin & Stalin where loyalty was paramount.

### Post WW2
Post WW2 the USSR annexed a lot of territory and 'subjugated' some more. These countries would later go on to become either the USSR or the Warsaw Pact countries, collectively the Eastern Bloc.

The Warsaw pact in a TLDR declared 3 things
- Military Alliance
- Economic Support
- Loyalty to Communism

This divided the world into the USA & its allies i.e NATO and the Eastern Bloc or the warsaw pact forming the Iron Curtain: a series of fences and walls dividing europe into 2.

Post death of stalin & Krushchev's secret denunciation of Stalin, the USSR decided to lift many of his most repressive policies on moral & practicality grounds. Under destalinisation the names Stalin and Lenin were also removed (similar to denazification), like Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd

When Stalin died in 1953 the new Soviet leaders decided to lift many of the most repressive policies. There were several reasons for this. The first was the moral argument.

After MASSIVE STAGNATION in the 70s and 80s, in 1985 the *Union of Soviet Socialist Republics* decided to elect their new reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev. To fix the centrally planned, command economy.

## Economics
In this system the government prioritized the creation of machinery and large projects while giving consumer goods, innovativeness and quality a much lower priority. And due to the inefficiency of the USSR any project which was underperforming was just given more resources. [Read More](https://frontier.nukes.in/posts/Economics/kv8fbm80-02700/#incentive)

At the same time in order to show that 'communism was a superiour ideology' the govt also dumped money into weapons and machinery which increased GDP but not standard of living. This is a critical point. The USSR WAS NOT AN ECONOMY. It was an IDEOLOGY. The Soviet leadership took policy not out of a pragmatic point of view of what worked and what didn't, but instead created policy based on ideology regardless of whether it worked or not.

> There is plenty of everything. Land, oil and gas, other natural resources, and God gave us lots of intelligence and talent. Yet we live much worse than developed countries and kept falling behind them more and more. The reasons could already be seen. The society was suffocating in the vice of the command bureaucratic system, doomed to serve ideology and bear the terrible burden of the arms race. ~ Gorbachev

This is in stark opposition to capitalism. Under a capitalist economy, there are many different independent production lines, leaderships and policies. There is maximum competition under whatever regulation exists.

Gorbachev wanted the Soviet Union to finally realize that old communist dream. He felt that after Stalin, the Soviet Union should have given far more rights to the people and created a healthy communist system. Under his new `perestroika` (reformation) idea he wanted more `glasnost` (openness). So he sought to
- End the Secret Police
- Bring in freedom of speech
- And cut down on bureaucracy

## Gorbachev Years
### Gorbachev (MSG) was a communist
MSG was very much communist and didn't believe it was a poor system but that the USSR was a poor implementation of it. The bloated bureaucracy didn't allow it to serve the very people it was created for.

MSG immidiately replaced senior management with new generation who favoured to change for example Boris Yeltsin (later president of Russia). One of the first things the new govt did was to improve relations with the outside world with 3 goals in mind
- Get Foreign Investment (now the famous Gorbachev Pizza Hut ad)
- Increase trade
- Improve relations with the likes of USA to end the cold war

So while on one end USA announced more military spending to stop the "evil empire". The USSR announced it would withdraw some of its military from the eastern bloc and reduce arms spending. It even left Afghanistan for this reason (not the Mujahideen as the americans like to say)

MSG initially implemented only small changes in 1985, but by 1987 he had converted USSR from command economy to a mixed economy where some parts of the economy could be planned by local officials and by local businesses themselves. Some private ownership was also allowed and prices became flexible. The businesses would be then owned by the workers and not the govt. They would no longer prop up failing businesses. Hmm. WhyDoesThisSoundSoFamiliar...

THIS IS CAPITALISM ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This was still however mixed and not capitalist so the means of production was still owned by the govt and there was strict regulation on minimum quotas etc. The problem now was that the Soviet govt didn't even know how badly their economy was mismanaged. The State Planning Commission didn't even have a working model of their own economy. So the idea was an absolute catastrophe in the beginning since businesses no longer knew what to do. Afterall they had 0 business experience. So due to large shortages, the govt had to actually start rationing goods.

The 2nd problem was that since taxes went down but spending didn't so the govt started getting more and more strained. The comedy is that the very bureaucracy which they intended to eliminate slowed them down from making the transition. So had the economy transitioned sooner they would have been able to earn more taxes (since people would have made more money and then spent more money and so on).

In his farewell speech Gorbachev even said "the old system collapsed before the new one could start working".

The final change implemented was giving the people more freedoms.
- Lifting Travel Bans
- Removing Secret Police
- Removing censorship on books and education
- Declassification of many documents

The new leadership also believed there is no reason we couldn't be Communist AND democratic at the same time. So that the leaders elected were at least answerable to the people. Unlike stalin

### Problems arise
The problem was not that the people didn't know they were being lied to. They knew that the propoganda was less than half true. What they didn't know was HOW MUCH they were being lied to. Till now. Due to Glasnost more and more people started getting to know just how bad the Soviet Economy was.

The problem at this point however was that the people were no longer thinking of fixing communism but leaving it.
