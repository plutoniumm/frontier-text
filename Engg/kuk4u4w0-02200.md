The 787 is probably the greatest airliner ever made, ending the race for larger and heavier and better capacity planes. Made primarily from composites, the 787 is a revolutionary change in how aircrafts are made.



# Construction
The 787 is the first commerical planet to be made solely from composite materials i.e, >50% of the aircraft is made from composite materials. The closest rival to the 787 is only the A350 XWD released 4 years after the 787. The composite material for the planes is carbon fibre dipped in plastic resin, the resin makes it solid and the carbon makes it flexible and incredibly strong.

Normal aircrafts are pressurised to an equivalent of 8000 ft which causes some people to have bloated stomachs and get air sickness, the stronger body of the 787 allows it to be pressurised to a lower altitude of 6000 ft much closer to ground. The stronger carbon also allows the plane to have much larger windows, since the ability to take pressure cycles at increased stress has now gone up significantly.

Composite materials have another advantage, they can be bent and cast into infinitely complicated shapes so therefore the need for small rivets and screws is gone and theirfore their bumps on the plane are gone since the whole part can now be manufactured as one single piece. This makes the plane more aerodynamic and reduces parasitic drag making the plane both smoother to ride and also saving much more fuel. Note that this fuel saving is double since now not only is the plane more aerodynamic but also lighter.


## Wings
The wings of any plane flex upward during flight, the stronger AND more flexible carbon fibre allows the plane to have a much higher flexibility and also takes much more force to bend it, this is again a double advantage to the wing. The 787 wings can flex by up to 3 meters mid flight. The FAA rule requires that any plane be tested at 150% of its max flying capacity and stay there for 3 seconds. In this test the 787 flexed for 7.6 meters. HOLY SHIT. Note that Carbon fibre also has a much higher elastic limit, so it can not only flex more but also stay there for longer.

### Aspect Ratio
The aspect ratio of a wing is its Span to Chord i.e Length to Width. So a high aspect ratio is something like a glider of between 20-30 whereas a low aspect ratio is something like a delta wing of 2-4. Traditional Aircrafts have an aspect ratio between 6-9, like say the 777 at 9. The 787 has an aspect ratio of 11. The primary objective of a high aspect ratio is to reduce the amount of drag the plane is under

When the high pressure air from above the wing mixes with the low pressure air from below the wing it forms a vortex on the tip of the wing which causes drag, a longer wingspan will allow for a much shorter vortex and therefore a much lower drag.

### Supercritical Airfoil
The lower aspect ratio reduces the amount of fuel a plane can carry so instead of the traditional airfoil, modern aircrafts use a supercritical airfoil.

![Supercritical Airfoil](https://i.imgur.com/pI8mrAw.png)

The first supercritical wing was tested by NASA on TF88 Crusader, the idea is that instead of just 2 we can use 3 dimensions to optimise for fuel storage, this allows for the same amount of fuel in a much higher aspect ratio with an additional (the main) benefit as follows.

The typical cruising speed of an aircraft is around 900 km/h whereas at its cruising height Mach 1 is around 1000-1050 km/h, as a consequence of this when the air moves around the wing, it causes flow acceleration. So even if an aircraft is moving at say 950 km/h the air around its wing is already supersonic. This is what limits the peak cruising speed of a commerical aircraft, since it causes a wake on the wing which produces astronomical drag.

The Supercritical wing creates greatly increases the critical mach number due to the flat top and also spreads out the formation of the Wave. This in turn reduces the net wave drag and also postpones it allowing the plane to achieve a slightly higher speed.

The exact shape of the wing changes throughout the actual wing along with the grain direction of the carbon fabric, this allows the engineers to control the precise amount of drag and stress at every single point on the wing. This causes the wing to bend at higher and higher speeds exactly as the engineers want it to, called "Aero-Elastic Tayloring" thereofore controlling the actively drag at the wing.

### Drag Delay (SPECULATION)
On the rear wings of the 787 are small ducts first tested in the 757 which pull the boundary layer air in and through a system of compicated plumbing push it out of the rear, it is said that this causes fuel consumption to reduce by up to 30% as the boundary layer turbulence is delayed significantly.


## Titanium (Ti)
A very large (15%) chunk of the plane is surprisingly made out of Ti. The reason for that is that on the galvanic series, when two materials far away from each other are stuck together the one higher on the series starts corroding at a rate much higher than normal, so in composite planes this happens to Aluminium (Al) which basically dies under the presence of Carbon. So to mitigate this challenge Boeing at the risk of significant losses moved a lot of parts away from Al while trying to minimise the cost of Ti.

So the cockpit window frames which are earlier Ti are now specially coated Al, the gates which were earlier Ti are now Al. Boeing has also partnered with Norsk Titanium which 3D prints the parts, the cost for this is the buy to fly ratio for machined parts is very very high since a lot of the metal is thrown away when machining. In case of 3D printing this ratio is extremely close to 1. 3D printed parts however have the risk that since they are made essentially from powder, they fail much faster than cast and cut since there are many many more Âµ-imperfections.

Norsk has created an innovative method to combat this which uses wires instead of powder and is monitored during the process of casting at 600 fps for extreme quality control. This resulted in the first ever FAA certified 3D printed structural components and they first flew in the 787. The advantage to this method additionally is that is allows for 50-100x manufacturing speeds and also uses 25-50% less Ti.


## Electricity
The 787 earlier had an extremely complex lightening protection system, the insulating caps did not allow lightening to reach the fasteners which was backed furthur by the compression rings and edge sealants minimising caps which can cause sparks and discharges. There was a copper mesh to safely conduct the electricity away from the wings and finally a system of filling the fuel tank with nitrogen. When there is no Oxygen, fires cannot happen.

Boeing since in a cost saving measure has removed the copper mesh and insulating caps in interest of reducing costs. This drew great criticism but Boeing's argument is that statistically the plane is safe enough with the existing systems to prevent what it needs to.


## Temperature
In some places where other materials could not be used and metals were absolutely necessary, Al was used as in the case of leading edges. Despite all its advantages Carbon fibre has 2 major problems

### Sudden Impacts
Carbon fibre immediately crumbles under sudden impacts and proves to be extremely brittle. For this metals are really effective as in here Al can slightly deform and prevent damage. Usually bird strikes and similar are seen to be primary dangers and protecting just the leading tips of the plane in such cases is sufficient to be both safe and not be wasteful.

### De-Icing
When in air, planes need to be able to de-ice since this SEVERELY impacts its its efficiency and causes a lot of drag.

In all aircrafts the above wing heating system is used to heat the wing, this add significant weight and complexity, and since the air has also to then be pumped out the plane loses efficiency due to turbulence. In case of the 787 the Al leading strips have electric blankets under them when can heat the plane as needed when needed in the air. This gets rid of all the complexity and dumping of air. The new system is 2x more efficient and the 787 is the first commerical aircraft to ditch the old mechanism.



# Engines


## Auxiliary (dependents)

### Ignition
In most cases an air compressor is needed to start the engine and get it moving the the few 1000 RPM it needs to be even in stand still running. So hand cranking it like the WW era or using a compressed air explosive cartridges like military aircrafts (C130) is not possible. The SR71 even used external engine batteries which ran 2 V8 engines in an external box and then via a connection spun up the main engines.

So what most modern planes do is they use a small engine (APU) in the tail of the plane which has its own compressed air shooters. The 787 also has an APU but with a very different mechanism. It has a small battery which starts the APU itself and then 6 secondary generators all electric which then start the main engine. 2 at each engine, if all 6 Generators were running at once it would be a total of 1.45MW of power.

### Air Intakes
The cabin is also cooled using the air from the APU normally, as it first runs through a complicated cooling system and then is used to cool the cabin. This complicated cooling system uses external air via RAM intakes to act as the air which carries the hot air away. This is just waste energy to take extremely hot air and cool it down.

The 787 now takes in the cabin air and RAM air from 2 inlets and uses electric systems to then cool the air and put it into the cabin just after running through an HVAC system.

### Brakes
WHen a 787 (a 200 ton plane) is landing, it has close to 1 GigaJoule of energy. Stopping a plane this heavy is not easy, while there exist reverse thrusters which redirect engine air backwards by opening vents, the vast majority of the Kinetic ENergy needs to be taken by the brakes. In the most extreme brake test (The V1 test, the final speed at which a plane can abort landing), the brakes glow red hot.

The 787 gets rid of most of the brake hydraulics and replaces them all with electro-hydraulic brakes. This significantly improves performance and reduces weight.

### Electric Components
Due to this massive amount of electricity available Boeing also decided to transform the whole cockpit into a electric modern HUD type cockpit similar to jet fighters. Pilots can now see important information on the glass in the HUD as they are flying, most of the sensors and gauge displays also have been changed from mechanical to electric. Pilots can even see the landing strip overlaid on the screen even in extreme dense fog.

The windows also now have a 5 level dimming system where they don't need to be covered and can simply be dimmed.

## Main Engine

The New GE NX-1B engine produces the same ~350kN thrust as the previous 767 generation but consumes 15% less fuel while doing so. This is primarily done by giving the plane a bypass ratio of 9:1 (previous 5.7:1), while most of the work is done by the engine, most of the air passing into the engine never enters the main compressor but just leaves via the bypass. The increase in bypass size is largely why most modern engines keep getting larger and larger.

This increasing bypass ratio causes the centrifugal force to increase, this was countered by replacing the full Ti blades with Ti leading edges on Carbon fibre blades and also reducing the count from 22 to 18 blades giving an overall 15% weight reduction.

The second method is increasing the pressure ratio of the engine allows us to extract more useful work from it (for thermodynamics reasons). The dreamliner is the first aircraft that uses new advanced Titanium Alumina alloys replacing the old nickel alloys which allows them to use the lightness of Al with the durability of Ti. And also machining the compressor in one single piece instead of using dovetail connections therefore increasing reliability and efficiency. This took them to a pressure ratio of 58:1.

The third method is GE used a new type of fuel injection which has been in development for 3 decades with the help of NASA and finally assisted by 3D printing they were able use this to achieve an astronomically amazing air to fuel mixture and therefore also a 60% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.

The NX engine chevrons in the end i.e the sawtooth things help the engine also to be 60% quieter than before giving a better ride. Rather than emit large vortices which generate the actual noise, the sawtooth breaks the vortices into much smaller chunks which can also get dissipated much faster.
