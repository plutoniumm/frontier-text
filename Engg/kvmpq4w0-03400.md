A Wind tunnel might be open to the world or it could be arranged in a loop with air circulating and reducing the power requirements and there'll be all sorts of vanes and grid type devices to direct and control airflow and try to make the flow as smooth and laminar as possible. Either way it is well known that prop aircrafts can't cross the supersonic barrier (as seen with XF84 Thunderscreech which effectively turned fuel into sound and not speed).

| **Speed (Mach)** | **Flow Type**  | **Examples**                    |

## Increasing Speed
The most obvious way would be to constrict to a small area from a large one since ```Av = const``` so to maintain continuity when area is decreased the velocity is increased.  This however is only possible so long as air does not compress which happens very very fast on even slight speed ups. After 0.3 the speed can be increased very inefficiently by constriction to Mach 1 beyond which it does not go and just becomes denser and hotter.

The next step is to actually start widening the channel again so that all this stored heat and pressure gets converted to velocity and we can easily cross 1 Mach with this. This choke and widening is EXACTLY as seen in Rocket engines, with the minor difference: Rocket chokes are circular i.e they make a cone and an inverted cone. This is not necessarily the case for wind tunnels which may just choke in 2 dimensions instead of all three forming a kind of trapezoidal frustrum.

These choke can also be controlled so as to change the choke value for different speeds for sake of optimisation.

Now the next optimization can be done in the fan where the earlier less effective fan is replaced with pumps, making the structure a form of a rudimentary jet engine in order to compress the gas more effectively. Theres also rapid response instrumentation which can perform all sorts of tests very quickly using a blow down tunnel they're basically driven by compressed gas tanks where there's a high pressure reservoir of gas that gets pumped up to whatever is necessary you open the valve and then blow that over your tunnel for to get results for like minutes sometimes fractions of a second and there's actually they'll also have blow down spheres, these massive spherical objects they're vacuum tanks that the gas flows into.

## Logistics
One problem that occurs when speeding up gas is that as it expands it cools. So when done so at very large scales if we use air then water and other high melting point cases just condense out. We can see this happening around rockets even when they are taking off such as in the space shuttle nose cone. When aiming to do Mach 20 almost everything condenses out making Helium the only cheap and feasible alternative gas. While it is true that air can be heated up before hand to keep the net temperature drop above liquidisation point it quickly turns unfeasible as normal air starts liquefying around 4-5 Mach and heated air (+900 deg) around another +2-3 Mach.

The problem with running air at Mach 20 is that. Helium is monoatomic and therefore doesn't have realistic air like properties. But well so is air heated at 5000 deg (required for Mach 20) as unrealistic. In both cases we are in roughly the same amount of soup. Helium happens to be the cheaper option here eliminating all the thermal management hassle. Short of putting the ship in the actual scenario this is probably the best we can do. There are other optimisations like air guns and jets and all but those all cause minor improvements each extremely specific to the given use case.

Viewing the behaviour is another challenge. At very low speeds the most common method is just to use different colour air (As in Cover of this note). At higher speeds it is better to use Schleirn imaging which exploits the fact that as air moved around object it has different densities causing the air to have different refractive indices. At times we can see a shadow of transonic cone even on passenger planes, this is similar to the Schleirn effect. In case of helium the density is very low and when expanded out it is even lower so this approach does not work. So what NASA does it they use an electron beam which causes these extremely small changes in density to show up like a glow making the air path very clear.

At times nitrogen traces are put in since it is better at reacting to the electron beams with better colours. Now we know what is happening with this 50 year old Mach 20 NASA image.
