## Ocean Currents
All the ocean currents of the world are tied together in one single belt called The Ocean Conveyor. We measure ocean currents in sverdrups. 1 sverdrup = 1 million m<sup>3</sup>/s. All the world's rivers combined have a flow of 1 sverdrup. The Conveyor has a stream of 10 sverdrups. Surface currents are dependent on
- Features
    - Tides
    - Rotation of Earth
    - Shape of land
- Water
    - Temperature
    - Depth
    - Salinity

**The Thermohaline Circulation**: At higher latitudes cold water gets saltier and evaporates due to wind. Water also freezes into ice further leaving more salt in water. This water becomes denser and falls deeper. Water from the equator heats up due to the sun and becomes saltier and is carried upwards by winds like the gulf stream. This wind throws the water from the americas to Europe heating it in the process. This heat is then dumped into Europe and water cools down and the cycle starts again.

This cycle is why despite being at same latitudes London (5&deg;) and the Canada (-11&deg;) have wildly different temperatures. The aforementioned section of the Conveyor is called AMOC (*Atlantic Meridional Overturing Circulation*).

**Global Warming**: If greenland's ice were to melt and dump much fresh water into AMOC. It would slow down the sinking of salty water and by consequence the AMOC and by consequence the whole conveyor.

### Timing F1
Transponders on F1 cars allow them to be tracked to within a ten thousandth of a second by transmitting radio waves. Timing loops are set about 1 cm into the F1 track, built out of lengths of wire that run across the width of the track and back protected in silicone. They’re spaced out every 150-200 m along the track, every time a car passes over it registers with the car’s transponder, transmitting a unique ID to a decoder that logs the time of day.

### ML Hardware
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owe9cPEdm7k -->
The core of ML is a MAC (Multiply Accumulate func). A &larr; A + (B x C). Even something as small as mobilenet needs 550M+ MAC operations to make a single inference. The cycle of fetching the data to ALU takes much longer & power to calculate the data itself (O(1):O($$10^2$$)). So we need Multiple ALUs which can store more data. Enter GPUs.

Problem is GPUs use 32/64 bit floating point. Which is over-processing for ML use cases. We need at max 8B integer. This is ideal for CNNs. Google TPU is one such ex. Analog machine learning currently faces two problems, latency and accuracy. Data conversion takes time & heat and noise may change the result.

### Jupiter
Taylor–Proudman theorem (after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and Joseph Proudman) states that when a solid body[clarification needed] is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high angular velocity Ω, the fluid velocity will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. Ω must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the Coriolis force large compared to the acceleration terms.

## Bengal Politics
### History
Post independence, even after independence, zamindars owned more than 93% of the total 1 cr worth land (as per Revenue Ministry of Bengal). 25th March ’67, with the killing of a bataidar by a zamindar marked the start of a new movement where farmers came together to fight, This started in the city. Of Naxalbari. This was lead by Charu Mazumdar.

This caused a split such that INC was now the party of the upper class/zamindars, CPIM was the party of the middle class and CPIML was of the SC/ST who had no land. Even after Charu’s death political killings became much more common now that Bombs and all were everywhere. This movement spread across Calcutta like a wild fire in places like DumDum, Tollygunj, Jadavpur etc.

People in these protests were later killed by the police in fake encounters. By 71 elections every party had their own goons, in ’71 INC used their goon power and won the state elections. The left movement was still very popular despite this, therefore giving them the Govt in ’77. Once in power they did 2 things
- Operation Borga: Taking the land back from the zamindars and redistribution of it amongst those farmers with no land.
- They also developed Panchayti Raj Institutions. With the influx of money, Panchayti elections (then 67% influence) became much much more important for SC/ST support

While this may have reached the politics. It changed Bengal politics for ever. CPIM shut down all form of democracy, they got rid off all newspapers which were against them. CPIM created a party society system where the individual identity in alignment with a political party had far more significance than the cast, gender or any other form. This system virtually removed any difference between the party and the society.

This probably came about due to the fact that most issues in any place were solved by zamindars. But due to Borga they no longer had any power, this hole was filled by CPIM workers which caused them to become a part of the society. The party just could not solve rural issues and stay in power they also had to do something for the public, as a consequence of which there was release multiple schemes. Schemes that were powered by the Govt’s money but the party claimed it as their own. Over time the Govt efficiency and also the schemes money started running thin so the schemes started differentially benefiting people. Those which gained became party supporters, those which didn’t became opposition.

This created strict party line divides. It was a blood bath. An example of this is Marichappi Massacre where Dalit refugees fleeing from East Pakistan were coming to Bengal. The CPIM Govt killed these people or starved them to death, simply because those people refused to stay where CPIM wanted them to stay or did not want any political alliance.

### Enter TMC
TMC now started taking the poor man’s side which long ago CPIM was. This caused multiple protests notably the Nandigram protest. This caused Didi to become very popular in Bengal, and won TMC the ’11 election. The political unrest in bengal was never about caste and religion, these issues were largely never touched.

As per research, when BJP entered politics in 2013, this political view started skewing and bengal started having a tenfold increase in religious riots. It is not relevant if TMC is playing any of the religious appeasement that they are accused of, what matters is the image. BJP is playing smartly to this image and increasing polarization as seen in the ’19 and ’21 riots.

### The big picture
The violence is usually occurring when a political party loses their grip and uses violence to keep that. To bengal politics and violence are just two sides of one coin. The coin never changes, just the hands. Zamindars, CPIM, TMC, BJP etc etc.

## Virus Dead or Alive?
Assigning a fixed definition to what is dead or alive is very difficult
Considering virus is dead or alive is a matter of definition. If we define something then it is possible that there are some things which are also more alive than viruses get excluded Ex. certain bacteria at times turn dormant and become spores they do not grow or divide until the wake up but yet these bacteria are not considered dead. Wolbachia found inside the cells of many insects, these bacteria cannot survive for a very long on their own just like viruses.

If we try to say that the distinction is for those people who possess genetic machinery to redefine their code then also we run into a problem there are some viruses like mimivirus these were initially thought to be bacteria because they were so large that they could be seen with the regular microscope, these have 900+ gene pairs much more than the previously thought 200ish. Neither Mimivirus nor Wolbachia can reproduce on their own.

And what about Mitochondria which have their own DNA and make their own energy. These came into being because some other bacteria set up shop in a cell, not very different from the aforementioned Wolbachia. There are further complications due to the existence of Viroids, Retro Viruses, Selfish Genomes etc.

### The Road not Taken - Robert Frost

<em>other, as just as fair</em> & <em>Had worn them really about the same</em>. This has an implication that both roads looked identical. He first says they are worn different, but then he says they are worn the same. The speaker himself here doesn't know how differently the roads are worn. This means our speaker is indecisive and impulsive, he had no reason to pick one path over another. This is further corroborated by the fact that when he picked one path, he kept thinking about the other path that he didn't take.

So <em>I shall be telling this with a sigh</em>, the speaker has clearly made up the fact that he took the road less travelled based on some internal self justification or some information not in the poem. Since based on the data given, since both roads are equally worn, the road less travelled doesn't exist. This is a bit because our brains have a tendency to think we are rational so we fill in logic to convince ourself. This poem is not about <i>Choosing your own road</i>, instead it is about <i> Self-Rationalization</i>. We can't choose between two things that are equal (<em>both...*...equally lay</em>), so the speaker came up with a reason to make sense of his choice. There is no reason. He just made one up.
