In the early days of the war hitler use to roll around in a train which acted like his mobile headquarters and he used to effectively rule from the train. He is then greeted by a sight of soldiers returning from the eastern front all wounded and injured. Rather than saying an inspiring word for the people who risked their lives for him, Hitler turns around and asks them to close the blinds of the train so that he doesn't have to see them. His mood becomes spoilt and even worse for someone who's name is already Adolf Hitler.

## Post Stalingrad
Feb '43, Berlin after losing Stalingrad, the Nazi PR machine Goebbels kicks into action. In front of 14000 people carefully chosen Goebbels does his careers most famous speech. "Do you want total war?".

Hitler's decisions at the same time were of increasingly poorer quality since losing Stalingrad made him less confident of his generals and his generals less confident of him (including Heinrich Himmler). Furher speeches would just become pointless and Hitler would keep rambling for 20 minutes. Hitler now wants a decisive blow on the Russians and looks to attack the bulge formed outside Kursk (with 1M soldiers), so he can take back kursk and make it a straight line again.

Hitler chooses the architecht of the blitzkrieg, Manstien. April '43 Hitler intends to form a citadel and traps the Red Army in a pincer. (YEH KYA PINCER PINCER LAGA RAKHA HAI 6 MEHNE SE). As Russia starts using its full industrial might to arm up even Hitler releases the new Tiger 1 tank. Arguably the most revolutionary tank ever. It had 100mm armour and was strong and precise so it could not only blast a tank from a mile away but also blast just its turret off if needed. At the same time he starts producing brand new Panther tanks as a response to the recent Russian T34s. Hitler even had deployed a new Wonder Weapon, the Ferdinand Tank Destroyer which had precisely that role, it was named after its famous inventor. Ferdinand Porsche (founder of Porsche).

## Battle
(May '43) During main battle day however Hitler gets cold feet for reasons a nobody knows till date and eventually he gets news that the Russian Red Army has started bombing their fields with their planes and have destroyed 500 Luftwaffe planes. What we also comes to realise further is that the new Panther tanks are untested and the soldiers are not ready to fight them on battalion level yet, over and above all of which given the haste in production often panther tanks off turn out to have defects in them.

At the same time due to slow production of Tiger tanks (12/week) hitler wants to delay but with each passing week Manstien becomes more anxious about success. As a result of Hitler's indecisive nature July '43 the Red Army starts moving in. They are now even prepared for the incoming Tigers due to Hitler's delay. So Soviets use Ammo in amounts unseen ever before. By the time the Germans even came close to Kursk the Soviets had fortified it to be borderline invincible with millions of mines, many tanks traps, 3000 miles of trenches etc.

### How did the Soviets know?
The Soviets were so well prepared in part because they knew what was coming beforehand. So the German senior intelligence started growing suspicious that there was something other than Hitlerâ€™s delay which is causing them to lose so significantly. Just Weeks Earlier around 2000 miles West of Kursk in the English countryside in an English style old house a group of young mathematicians have sat down to crack the German code.

John Caircross on of the Bletchley Park 5 was actually a soviet spy and used to pick up decrypted papers and smuggle them out of England which would go directly to Stalin. As a result of this intel the soviets more or less knew every single move of the attack and started by bombing the 500 planes and preparing accordingly.

## Progress
This slow loss made hitler weaker and slower (read further in Battle of Bulge).

While the north flank of hitler's pincer didn't do much the south flank was moving strong.
