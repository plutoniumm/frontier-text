# Israel
The war this time around is mainly due to a region called Sheikh Jarra. Palestinians have been protesting to live in the city claiming it as theirs since centuries. 8th May saw a Palestinian public vs israeli police riot near Al Aqsa Masjid.

### History
Very long ago Jews used to live in the region Judea, now Jerusalem. The Jewish-Roman wars led the Romans to break all Jewish temples and force them to flee all around the world. A large number of them were in Europe. Due to discrimination and no land rights, they tended to become money lenders and traders. For a while all of EU was figuring out who they were and what the national identity was. Jews were never a part of any of these decisions. Due to Alfred Dreyfus being falsely labelled as Traitor and jailed, Theodore Herschel wrote a manifest ‘The Judenstaat’. This basically declared that Jews need their own nation and Jerusalem would be the best place to center that around.

### Territory
Post the British-Ottoman wars, the british took over the region of palestine and established israel in their Balfaur Declaration. This was directly opposed to Sikes-Pycot Agreement (FR-GB) which declared that palestine was under international control. Then the League of Nations (now UN) gave the Brits the control for Palestine. This caused a rapid BOOM in the fraction of jewish people in palestine. This caused protests and riots. The brits proposed a 100% arab state within 10 years and promised to restrict jewish immigration. But they could not control the same due to Holocaust. Brits gave up and slowly israel removed palestinians from Palestine and created a bifurcated state.

### Post Split
There were many protests from Palestinians in a series of mass resistance movements called ‘Intefada’. There was then a peace treaty which caused israel-Palestine to temporarily accept the bifurcation and have independent governance. The people who caused this to happen also wont the Nobel Peace Prize. This didn’t last long as the then israeli leader was shot by an israeli citizen under the pretext that ‘he was giving away the state to the arabs’. This paved the way for rise of Netanyahu whose campaign was that of no compromise with the palestinians. Palestine is in 2 parts, Hamas and Fatah. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip and Fatah governs the west bank.

### Terror
While Fatah is willing to accept the 1967 borders and live in peace. Hamas wants israel to not exist anymore and uses violence as a tool for their objective. This also caused a civil war in palestine internally between Hamas and Fatah due to inconclusive negotiations. As a result of a lot of Hamas supporting countries coming out in favour of israel, Hamas as of 2017 claimed that they will also accept the borders of ‘67. israel gains a lot of favour from Bahrain and Qatar due to trade and defence benefits, since their common enemy is Iran.

## Iran
In iran there is a very large mountain range where salt from under the range over millions of years has come up from cracks and formed massive km long colourful glaciers. Since they are made of salt they cannot melt, only in very rare cases just dissolve away in water.

## Territorial Waters
A region of 12 nautical miles outside coast of any country is territorial sea. For 200 nautical miles outside land the nation has exclusive economic zone or sole rights to resource exploitation. In case of conflict each country resolves on case by case basis. Such as India-Sri Lanka where USUALLY midway line is drawn. Most un countries have signed this except Syria, Israel & Turkey. Their waters are therefore still under dispute mainly in the Aegean Sea.

As a consequence of these disputes also Cyprus is now divided into Republic of Cyprus (Internationally recognized) and Turkish Republic of Cyprus (Only Turkey recognized). Search for gas is making this worse. This currently creates two different sea ownership maps. One agreed upon by Greece-Egypt and one by Turkey-Libya.

Of all of the worlds gas reserves the highest are held by Russia followed by Iran then Qatar & USA. iraq economy is dependent on 98% exports of Oil & Azerbaijan is also along similar lines 91% mineral products. Turkey on the other hand imports 30% of its national electricity source which is Natural Gas from Russia (50%) and rest Iran, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Nigeria and Qatar.

The Turkstream pipeline and the Trans-Balkan Pipeline can be used to make turkey also a transit country and the lines were recently updated to make direction of flow reversible.
