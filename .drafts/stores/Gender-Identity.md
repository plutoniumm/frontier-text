**Stats**: The gender disphoria in america was 2% students. That is an increase from 0.01% by 200x times. [[*CITATION NEEDED*]()]

**Time agrument**: The argument is that initially the larger chunk of people who were gender disphoric were males. So if this was a problem of social constructs which does not exist now, then there should be an explosion in the number of reporting males [[*CITATION NEEDED*]()]. But we see the number explosion in females [[*CITATION NEEDED*]()]. Critiques are attributing this rise to hysteria.

Evidence to back up the critiques is that women tend to engage in this kind of behaviour more frequently. Hospitals have rules not keep anorexics together [[*CITATION NEEDED*]()], because they end up encouraging each other. Women tend to socialise by 'sharing pain' so they encourage each other to cut [[*CITATION NEEDED*]()].

Kids who are upper middle class and privilaged are the vast majority of the demographic. They have no reason to be victimsed and hence create one, they become oppressed/a minority [*Lisa Littman Study*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330).

**PARADOX**: How is gender immutable and a social construct at the same time. If gender fluidity is a thing then how can you recommend surgury to someone who is fluid. What if they regret it?

**Problems**: Girls who have taken surgery are showing consistently unhealthy patterns across the board
- No stable employment/financial systems
- Only trans circles, they end up hating all cis people
- They are cutting of their parents
- They are dropping out of school
