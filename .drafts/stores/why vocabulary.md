So what happens is

The words you use actually dictate how you think. Because in a lot of cases it has been shown that not knowing certain words dictate that you cannot acknowledge the existence of an object. This has been studied very well scientifically in RCTs but for sake of making a point & simplicity. I'll use 2 examples


1: Ao

In ancient Japan there was no word for 'Green' so it has been seen repeatedly that they could not actually tell the difference between blue and green. So TILL today, despite 'midori' coming to light meaning green, the actually call green veggies 'Ao' which is Jap for blue. And so it was seen that in ancient Japanese literature, the colours green and blue were used interchangeably since they saw no difference in them. Similarly in Ancient Greece the word for 'Blue' didn't exist, so it has been well studied and seen in literature that they used to actually call it black or white depending upon time. So day sky is white but night sky is black, this also marks the origin of most words of darkness today which signify a night sky, because to the Greeks it was black
Extension:

Designers have better eyes for spotting colour differences in modern world. Why? Because they have more words for more colours, they are very internally familiar with Pink, Magenta and Fuscia and can see even the tiniest differences. Whereas for a layman they are all PINK and even LOOK the same.


2: Love

In North Korea today. Most people are controlled on what they can and cannot think but deleting words from vocabulary. So there is not word in North Korean for Lover, Friend, Acquiaintance etc. It is all Comrade. So as a result, the testimonies of defectors make it clear that love marriages are scarce and strong interpersonal relations are rare. Even marriages are done by the govt. This is similar to George Orwell's 1984 where the Ministry of Truth every year DELETES words from the dictionary so that people think less and less freely and more and more on propaganda, such people were called 'duck speakers' in a sense that they were machines and had no free thought. The whole Proles community were one such weaker example, they had no political or freedom thought. To them this was normal
Extension:

Nissim Taleb has introduced two new words into the everyday life Black Swan and AntiFragile. As a result of black swan FBI has actually started teaching negotiators on how to find the one hidden info which can win you an argument with absolute leverage. It may sound obvious in hindsight, but without the word it didn't occur to anyone in a generic labelled context to use it. With AntiFragile doctor have started practising more of non interventionism, where if a child willl get well on his own, don't medicate him. This was a big problem in the Crack and now Fentanyl epidemic. With the new word we realise kids are Anti Fragile and therefore don't treat shit which goes away on its own


So what happens basically is

New words literally open your mind to new thought. Specially in case of english

Because English is a very versatile language. Any words which the language doesnt itself have words for, it just steals from others and integrates seamlessly ex. Loot, Zeitgeist, Bourgeois etc etc
Notice how describing what Bourgeois or Zeitgeist in plain English will take a lot more words. Which reduces you information processing capacity because of the 40 bit limit. So you spend 50% of the limit just describing these words and hence can do and explore less. But when you do one word. You have 90% of your limit to play with. So you can think more and explore more and form more complex sentences, thus Bourgeois giving rise to labour theory and zeitgeist giving rise to all the rapid adaption & cultural mixing we see today

Therefore

The more words you know. The smarter you are, because you can form more COMPLEX, more PRECISE and more COHERENT sentences


Why the word limit
[4:54 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: COMPARED TO ENGLISH

Japanese is a much LESS dense language. And you know how fast the Japanese speak. German on the other hand is a much MORE dense language so the germans and even Dutch speak slower AF
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: Like tere waale hi use kar liya so you get it
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: So if you plot a graph
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: Of information density
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: And syllables per second
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: English is bang in the middle
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: And the product of the graph points
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: AT EACH LABGUAGE comes to about 38-40 bits per second
[4:55 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: Your brain just can't do more
[4:56 pm, 29/10/2021] Plutoniumm: Its a hard limit
