Women mate up and horizontally in the dominace heirarchy. (Refer JP book).

Women statistically don't talk more by a significant margin. The gap is <15% more. The only reason to why it  exists in the first place is because its about power dynamics. Women tend to be heard less and therefore to be heard tend to talk more. The

Women and men on an average are the same amout of funny. The difference is again <10% more. This also could be due to arbitrary chance.

# Data
Women don't work higher jobs in larger numbers because they would prefer to keep a family over the headache of waking up at 3 on one call. It is not a matter of ability but of choice

First, women have a strong proclivity to marry across or up the economic dominance hierarchy. They prefer a partner of equal or greater status. This holds true cross-culturally. The same does not hold, by the way, for men, who are perfectly willing to marry across or down, although they show a preference for somewhat younger mates.

# Reports
Women reported themselves to be higher in Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Warmth, and Openness to Feelings, whereas men were higher in Assertiveness and Openness to Ideas. Contrary to predictions from evolutionary theory, the magnitude of gender differences varied across cultures. Contrary to predictions from the social role model, gender differences were most pronounced in European and American cultures in which traditional sex roles are minimized

**Replication**: [*Frontiers in Psychology*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00178/full)

The effect for Neuroticism (with females scoring higher than males) begins to take on its adult form around age 14. Girls score higher on Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness at all ages between 12 and 17 years. A more complex pattern emerges for Extraversion and Agreeableness, although by age 17, sex differences for these traits are highly similar to those observed in adulthood. Cross-sectional data suggest that (a) with advancing age, sex differences found in adolescents increasingly converge toward adult patterns with respect to both direction and magnitude; (b) girls display sex-typed personality traits at an earlier age than boys; and (c) the emergence of sex differences was similar across cultures.

Results showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things–People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d = −0.35), Social (d = −0.68), and Conventional (d = −0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d = 1.11), science (d = 0.36), and mathematics (d = 0.34) interests. Average effect sizes varied across interest inventories, ranging from 0.08 to 0.79.
