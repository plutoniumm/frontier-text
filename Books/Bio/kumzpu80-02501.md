The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span. Sleep is the most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day. Human beings are the only species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep without legitimate gain.


## Mechanism

### Caffine
Sleep pressure, caused by a build-up of the chemical adenosine in your brain, is the second factor affecting sleepiness. Caffeine (the 2nd most traded commodity on the planet, after oil) works by blocking the receptors that adenosine affects (after about 30 minutes). This does not however affect the actual amount of adenosine which keeps building up in the background, so when the coffee wears off, there is a sudden jump in the effects of sleep pressure i.e post coffee crash.

Some people process caffeine faster than others, and we get less efficient as we age.

To identify sleep deficiency:
- If you didn’t set an alarm clock, would you wake up on time?
- Do you find yourself re-reading things?
- Can you function optimally before noon without caffeine?

**Jet lag**: occurs when the sleep cycle is disturbed by moving it by a few hours. In general traveling to the west is easier than the east since we can stay awake for longer more easily as opposed to sleep earlier. Each night the brain can recover a maximum of an hours sleep. So for example on moving from India to London, 5 days is needed to actually start functioning fully normally again.

Caffeine is far more dangerous than you can even remotely comprehend. A sleepy driver is technically at much higher risk than a drunk driver. The only problem is that we don't see it enough because after a crash there is a sudden jolt and the person is woken up. So post crash, no one was ever sleepy. Alcohol is just more visible because it doesn't just 'evaporate' post car crash like sleep does.


## Sleep Pattern

Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Gabra in northern Kenya or the San people in the Kalahari Desert, sleep in a biphasic pattern. Both these groups take a similarly longer sleep period at night (7-8 hours), followed by a 30-60 minute nap in the afternoon. They go to sleep two to three hours after sunset, around 9 PM. Midnight is supposed to be “mid-night.” Instead, for many of us, it’s usually the time when we consider checking our email one last time. All humans, irrespective of culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip in alertness that occurs in the mid-afternoon hours. When we are cleaved from the innate practice of **biphasic** sleep, our lives are shortened.

### Self-Identifying Sleep

- Most Sleeping organisms adopt a stereotypical position.
- Sleeping organisms have lowered muscle tone. This is sometimes visible visually and always via machines.
- Sleeping individuals show no overt displays of communication or responsivity.
- Sleep is easily reversible, differentiating it from coma, anesthesia, hibernation, and death.
- Sleep adheres to a reliable timed pattern across 24-hours (for sun dependent organisms at least)
- The thalamus is the sensory gate of the brain. It puts up a perceptual barricade to block incoming sensory signals while you sleep.
- You consciously lose track of time while you sleep, this is also why a 5 min nap feels like an eternity in a dream.
- But your subconscious brain is still capable of logging time with quite remarkable precision while asleep. Thus, why you sometimes wake up right before your alarm goes off.
- When you dream, you maintain a sense of time, however, it is not particularly accurate. Often dream-time is prolonged relative to real time. It isn't known so far if its a fixed ratio or formula, we know it is a wide range.

### Two Types of Sleep
**NREM** = Non-rapid eye movement
- Four stages of increasing depth
**REM** = Rapid eye movement
- Brain activity almost identical to when we’re awake
- Associated with dreaming

### Cycle
![REMCycles](https://i.imgur.com/c3BNSX0.png)

NREM and REM stages play out in a recurring, push-pull battle for brain domination across the night in 70-90-minute intervals (tending to 90 almost always).

A key function of deep NREM sleep, which predominates early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. \
The dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections.

A useful explanation is to think of it like a sculpture, NREM initially removes large blocks, then some small blocks are (added) carefully sculpted by REM. As this progresses overnight, the gross features take less and less time and the details take more and more therefore going from NREM dominated sleep to REM dominated.

In short \
*Being Awake*: Taking Data In \
*While NREM*: Reflecting on new data and cleaning old data \
*While REM*: Adding back the postprocessed data

Note: In REM sleep, the body enters a state called sleep paralysis. The purpose of this is to stop any form of motion i.e so that you don't act out your dreams. It is POSSIBLE and NORMAL but also UNLIKELY to wake up with sleep paralysis and usually happens when some external trigger breaks REM, you will not be able to move. Your body has effectively stopped any voluntary processes below neck. The best thing to do in such cases is to go back to sleep.


## Use, Age and Usage
### Age
**Prior to birth** — we spend almost all our time in REM. Infants and young children who show signs of autism, or who are diagnosed with autism, do not have normal sleep patterns or amounts. Most notably is the shortage of REM—30-50% less than children without autism.

**Childhood** — number of slumber phases is much higher than adults. The daily 24 hour rhythm isn’t developed until age 3–4. NREM proportion increases to 70% and stabilises by late teens to 80%. Deep sleep is a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around. Infants and young kids display polyphasic sleep: many short snippets of sleep through the day and night. The master 24-hour clock that controls the circadian rhythm—the suprachiasmatic nucleus—takes considerable time to develop.

**Teens** - During puberty, NREM sleep ramps up to prune brain connections with the goal of efficiency and effectiveness. Deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation. The circadian rhythm of adolescent teenagers shifts forward, so far that it passes the timing of their adult parents. So they want to stay up later. Asking your teenager to go to bed and fall asleep at 10 PM is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at 7 or 8 PM. Neither society nor our parental attitudes are well designed to appreciate or accept that teenagers need more sleep than adults, and that they are biologically wired to obtain that sleep at a different time than their parents.

Well now I know why I can't sleep.

**Late twenties** - adults start losing up to 90% of their deep sleep when we’re 70 years old.

**Adults** - We also start losing our sleep efficiency of 90–95% as kids to 70–80% which increases depression and the mortality rate. Sleep is more problematic and disordered in older adults. Older adults need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that (still necessary) sleep, the fact that they need less sleep is a myth. REM sleep remains largely stable in midlife. But the decline of NREM sleep is already under way by your late twenties and early thirties. The older we get, the more frequently we wake up throughout the night. The chief culprit is a weakened bladder. The lower an older individual’s sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness.

A final benefit of sleep for memory is arguably the most remarkable of all: creativity.

- Sleeping before learning refreshes our ability to make new memories.
- Napping increases learning ability (with stable concentration) and you are better at memorising — both by about 20%. \

- Sleep post-learning improves retained information by 20–40%. Sleep for learning is an all or nothing thing, not like a bank, if you catch up on sleep a couple of days later, it’s already too late. In ideally controlled experiments it was seen that people who slept consistently performed on a average 40% better than those who didn't sleep i.e in the real world the gap will be larger.

- In the context of injury, there is no better risk-mitigating insurance policy than sleep. Post-performance sleep accelerates physical recovery from common inflammation, stimulate muscle repair, and helps restock cellular energy in the form of glucose and glycogen. This is also why when sick we tend to be more sleepy. The body releases sleep pressure to stop all external actions so that maximum resources can be directed to recovery.

- Lastly, creativity. Sleep provides a nighttime theatre in which your brain tests out and builds connections between vast stores of information.

- Microsleep — sleep deprivation quickly leads to lack of concentration. Slowness is not the most sensitive signature of sleepiness, entirely missed responses are. What this effectively means in practice is: While driving a drunk driver will respond more slowly thus still maybe have a lower chance of accident against someone who is sleepy since they WILL NOT REACT AT ALL. They will not even be present there. This is clearly reflected in the stats. While drunk drivers have more crashes. Sleepy drivers have more kills.

#### Sports
Obtain anything less than eight hours of sleep a night, and especially less than six hours a night, and the following happens: time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30 percent, and aerobic output is significantly reduced. Similar impairments are observed in limb extension force and vertical jump height, together with decreases in peak and sustained muscle strength. Add to this marked impairments in cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory capabilities that hamper an underslept body, including faster rates of lactic acid buildup, reductions in blood oxygen saturation, and converse increases in blood carbon dioxide, due in part to a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can expire. Even the ability of the body to cool itself during physical exertion through sweating - a critical part of peak performance - is impaired by sleep loss.

Even teams that are aware of sleep’s importance before a game are surprised by my declaration of the equally, if not more, essential need for sleep in the days after a game. Post-performance sleep accelerates physical recovery from common inflammation, stimulates muscle repair, and helps restock cellular energy in the form of glucose and glycogen.


### Usage
Sleep is like clicking the “save” button. It protects newly acquired information against forgetting. The slow brainwaves of deep NREM sleep serves as a courier service, transporting memory packets from a temporary storage hold (hippocampus) to a more secure, permanent home (the cortex). Sleep clears out the cache of short-term memory for the new imprinting of facts, while accumulating an ever-updated catalog of past memories. Sleep salvages memories that appeared to have been lost soon after learning.

Can I just insert a short comment. THE BRAIN IS AWESOME.

Muscle memory is actually brain memory. Our brains remember how to do things. Practice, followed by a night of sleep, makes perfect. Daytime naps that contain sufficient numbers of sleep spindles also offer significant motor skill memory improvement, together with a restoring benefit on perceived energy and reduced muscle fatigue. Sleep is an insurance policy against injury.


## Other Species
Sleep is universal. Without exception, every animal species studied to date sleeps, or engages in something remarkably like it. Total amount of time is one of the most conspicuous differences in how organisms sleep. Elephants sleep just 4 hours. Brown bats sleep 19 hours. We don’t really know why it varies so much from one species to another.

All have measurable NREM sleep stages. Insects, amphibians, fish, and most reptiles show no clear signs of REM sleep—the type associated with dreaming in humans. The way species sleep varies widely.

Cetaceans (such as dolphins and whales) and birds sleep with half a brain at a time. REM sleep is strangely immune to being split across sides of the brain. Split brain sleeping only applies to NREM. Starvation will cause the search for food to supersede the need for sleep. In flight, migrating birds will grab remarkably brief periods of sleep lasting only seconds in duration.
