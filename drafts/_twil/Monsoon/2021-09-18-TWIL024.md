## Cross Flags
### Nordic
FORMAT: [BACKGROUND, CROSS COLOUR, if STRIPE]

**Denmark**:🇩🇰 Legend says that the Dannebrog fell from the sky in Estonia (a NOT nordic country) around ~1220 AD. The Danes were therefore the first to adopt a cross flag with [RED, WHITE]

**Iceland**:🇮🇸 Adopted when the country gained independence from Denmark in 1944. The colors officially have no symbolism, the cross is to symbolise the ties with the nordic countries [BLUE, RED, WHITE]

**Finland**:🇫🇮 The flags was adopted when the country gained independence from Russia. The white symbolises the snow of the country and blue symbolises the water in the land of a 1000 lakes. The cross is obviously nordic [WHITE, BLUE]

**Sweden**:🇸🇪 One of the oldest flags in the region and is been known to be inspired from the danish flag, the earliest depiction is from the 1600s where the colours could be seen on flags, the shields and court of arms. Blue and Yellow have always been traditional swedeish colours. [BLUE, YELLOW]

**Norway**:🇳🇴 Flag designed in 1821 and the cross obviously again is for nordic association. The red is for the danish union from 1397-1814 and the blue is for union with sweden from 1814-1905.

**Aland & Faroe Islands**:🇫🇴 Adopted for similar colours for similar reasons.

**Greenland**:🇬🇱 Nvm this tbh.

### British
**England**:🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 While England is in the same region and has very close proximity and even has some resemblance in economic success, the cross on its flag is purely coincidental and came about for very different reasons. They are not nordic.

The St George Cross flag is actually used for England, Genoa, Paroa, Bologna etc etc. St George was probably a dude who killed a dragon and became a saint.

Thr first flag (3 lions) was of Richard I around 1100s. Richard's father Henry II was the first Plantagenet king of England who was preceeded by the Norman (later associated also to Normandy) kings who also probably had a lion on their flag. The Danish before the Normans also were speculated to have a lion but we have no evidence. A few gens later Richard III attacked France and declared himself king of France also Adopting the Fleur Elysée and making a new 3 lions and fleur flag still on the Coat of Arms of england to this day.

During reign of Edward I in the 2nd Baron's war when a few Barons rebelled against him the royal troops were wearing Red Crosses who did so to differentiate themselves from the enemy who wore White Crosses. The popular story this sounds similar to crusades but that is independent of this since St George was a popular dude and that too the French were the red cross whereas the english were the white cross and the English probably adopted the cross from there. So in chronology, *English take Red Cross from French in crusades and use in 2nd Barons war*.

For lost of the middle ages there were multiple different flags and shields being used: The Red Cross, The Edwards Cross, the 3 crowns etc etc. Then in the mid 1500s during the English Reformation the king decided that the St George will be the only flag used since everything else represented the church and popery and etc. The dudes became protestant AF.

Then in 1606 after the Union of England and Scotland they decided to fuse the flags and create a new flag 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 + 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  = 🇬🇧 the Union or more popularly the Union Jack. (In all fairness there was an intermediate before the diagonal red stripes were added to signify Ireland's St Patricks Saltire). The union jack is now a part of a shit load of flags, well because...hmm. LORD SAVE THE GRACIOUS QUEEEEEEN #Colonisation.

## DeepWater Horizon
When drilling at sea floor is being done; oil, gas and water are under very high pressure and can rush up in a kick. This is prevented by a blowout stopper just above the drill.

The stopper have 3 major components, Pipe Rams, Annular Preventors and a Blind Sheer ram (looks like pipe ram)

When a blowout occurs the crew can close the pipe ram and the automatically operated annular preventor, if all else fails the sheer ram will cut the pipe and flow with it. When the deepwater oil had a kick, the crew managed to close the upper annular preventor and one of the pipe rams, while this temporarily stopped new oil from coming in this did not prevent any oil already in the system from rushing up.

This oil reached up and caused the first explosion. The oil just below the pipe ram was now under pressure and started increasing pressure inside the pipe. This caused the pipe to buckle. This caused the buckled pipe to move OUTSIDE the reach of the sheer ram blades.

### AMF Deadman
When all communication, power and signal from the rig fails the AMF Deadman is a switch run by two redundant systems (Yellow and Blue pop) which causes the pipe sheer ram to close. Due to a before hand miswiring the Blue pod was completely useless and couldn't close the ram.

The Yellow pod due to a miswiring caused the magnetic fields to be in opposite directions but another unplanned failure caused the red field battery to fail and therefore successfully operate the solenoid thus closing the ram. Despite closing due to buckling the ram failed.
