## Phi in Nature
### Euclidean Defn
The Mean Ratio now called phi was defined when on a line AB there is a point C such that. AB/AC = AC/CB = ø. I will now ignore the standard spooky math properties it has since I can derive them at convenience.

### Phi NOT in Nature
A lot of buildings are claimed to have been made with the golden ratio in mind, while this sounds good. Something as large as Eiffel Tower or Taj Mahal will have many different ways to measure it. SOME of it is bound to come close to 1.6. Or even in DNA one turn to one width is 34A to 21A about 1.6. BUT bear in mind Phi is not 1.6. It is EXACTLY (1 + √5)/2.

The mascot of Phi in nature is the Nautilus shell. The nautilus shell is a logarithmic spiral undeniably (grows by same ratio every time), its just that it varies and is SOMETIMES, APPROXIMATELY 1.6.

### Phi in Nature
Some places although like PineCones, Sunflowers, Pineapples, Artichokes etc, DO show the ratio. But these are all due to the fact that Phi is irrational so its a very effective way of getting maximum sunlight so the leaves/petals are the 1/IRRATIONAL_NUM * 360 degrees apart each time, case of Phi organically creating spirals. There are variations of these in other plants like best angle to funnel rain and bet angle to pack seeds etc etc.

### The most irrational
It turns out that of all irrational numbers Phi is the most. Consider writing Pi in a continued fraction, we notice Pi can be truncated to be approximated reasonably well within 5-6 steps say till 1/292. In case of Phi this never happens it is always 1/1/1/1/... etc. So effectively Golden ratio is the most rational and the most efficient way to run optimization loops in nature.

# MAIN STORIES
### Ice and Speed
Even if marginally, the melting of polar ice caps causes more mass to redistribute itself around the Earth and as a consequence slows down the rotation of the earth by a frac.

### Senbonzakura

Japan's cherryblossom peaks have been more or less consistent since 800s to 1800s for 1000 years. Since the industrial revolution due to all the carbon we have been dumping the planet is heating up more and more as a result of whichs summer is coming earlier & they bloom earlier.

### Bees shouldn't be able to fly...but really?
A bee creates lift by clapping its wings together above its back. When the wings separate, air fills the void, and the downward swinging wings generate lift. The failure to account for this is the basis for the myth that bees shouldn’t be able to fly.

### Just Japan things
Seiryu Miharashi station in Japan, a train station with no entrances or exits, no roads or paths to connect it, all it serves is a platform for the train passengers to step out and admire the valley
