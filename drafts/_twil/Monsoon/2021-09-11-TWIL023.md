## Aerodynamics of NASCAR
When a car moves at a very high speed, there a small high pressure area created in front of it and a low one at the back. This causes a small force to be developed which pulls the car backward.

### Slip Streaming
When a car is moving then just behind it is a small low pressure area this can be used by another car to get free pull in the forward direction thus increasing its speed with power left over. This is called slip streaming.

### Two Car Tandem
In a two car tandem the slip stream distance between the two cars is reduced to be almost or at times equal to 0. This causes there to not exist any low pressure area at the back of the first car allowing it to go it faster. This effectively eliminates any gap from the front or the back car letting them both go faster and since they are now aerodynamically a single object.

The rear car now with its leftover power can gently touch the front car and start pushing it thus making both cars go net faster. This is a perfect Two Car Tandem with Bump Draft.

### Slingshot
In just the last lap of the race the trailing car can use its extra boost to not push the front car but break out of the slip stream and overtake it to win the race. This can be further boosted by using side draft, where if the two cars are front bumper to front bumper side to side then the trailing car which will be inside can use the layout of the track to dump its dirty air onto leading car making its aero problem even worse.

### Shake n Bake
The only way to combat the slingshot is to slightly suddenly move sideways in a two car tandem this will expose the trailing car to a lot of drag and slow it down slightly just enough for the leading car to race ahead and win.

## Gurgaon (ggn)
The design of ggn has one major factor going for it. It is very very close to India's capital Delhi. So despite there being no Govt, the city has grown very fast. In 1957 The Delhi Development Act banned private real estate developers leaving nowhere to go but delhi. This was in turn hastened by Sanjay Gandhi who wanted to create a new car as the symbol of India and chose ggn as the place for that.

The Govt initially argued that the focus of the Govt should be on mass transit and not personal cars but owing to his status they folded. The car failed completely and was bought out by suzuki.

### Land
Maruti by 80's had started employing 20K workers in the city. Land laws being complicated and convoluted in india like non transferability or non heredity make the job harder except for in ggn where all land was under one single office. This got rid of all the beauracracy and mitigated most of the corruption.

Very soon due to lack of red tape and one single office Coca-Cola, GE, MicroSoft, AmEx, IndiGo etc settled in the city due to cheap labour. This caused a boom of 125K in 80s to 1.5M in 2020s. This also caused a boom in quality infra development where while delhi was badly made and poorly constructed ggn had great infra with complexes and pool houses.

### Demand and Supply
To generate more growth the companies simply created supply and generated demand for it. Rapid Metro is also the world's first 100% private modern metro system. To sponsor the projects the creator company auctioned off stations to recoup some of the fixed costs eg, Vodafone Belvedere Tower Station.

2/3rd of the city isn't even connected to the main sewage line, the waste is collected in a septic tank and dumped outside city walls. The city however had only 14 fire trucks when the Govt mandated 42 for a city of its size in 2008 that too with a max spray height of 40m in a city with buildings conveniently more than 2-3x that. The public system only as 4K security personnel whereas the private sector maintains 35K.

### Municipality
Despite already having 1M people the centre created a municipality for the first time in 2008 that too with almost 0 power, all they basically did was rename the city name which also was not given a lot of heed. When living in ggn if you are in one of the Godrej, Emaar or DLF owned estates you will have a life where tiger woods may play on your golf course but outside that life may not be so ideal. Extreme flooding will be common, electricity is sporadic, wasted in dumped into the rivers etc. AND THE HELL TRAFFIC OMG. This one time a judge had to halt toll collection to make the traffic move faster.

That the Canadian Air force is the 6th largest Air force in the americas behind: US Air Force, US Navy, US Army, US Marines, and Brazilian Air Force.

### Real life 4 color map
The rare confluence of a total four nations coming together on one spot only exists in Africa where the corners of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia meet. More than 4 is not possible as witnessed in the solution of the map colouring problem.

### Phillips vs Robertson
In the United States Robertson screws are not widely used. Apparently Henry Ford couldn’t make an exclusive deal with Robertson, instead made one with Phillips, and the rest is history. Phillips are still the most popular screw heads in the US despite their inferior design.

### Business lies in the Grey Market
In the early 2000’s, college kids were busy sharing “illegal” music downloads, and the record labels were busy suing college kids and forcing Napster into bankruptcy. Steve Jobs saw this as opportunity, created iTunes, and successfully got all the major record labels to agree to signing on for $1/download, turning an underground market into a billion dollar business. iTunes begat Pandora, which begat Spotify. And now here we are.

Grey markets flourish where consumer demand gets ahead of the law. Lots of people rented out bedrooms against local laws; Airbnb came along and turned it into a $4 billion business. Lots of private car companies flouted the oppressive taxi regulations; Uber came along and normalized it to the tune of $12 billion.

### Columbus "discovers" America
After the bearing strait was underwater again, the humans who had walked over to the Americas had no way of knowing that the Mainland Asians existed and the other way round. Even if there were small trades, these two land masses were largely oblivious of each other. Columbus was important not because he discovered America but because he reconnected two broken pieces of human civilization.

### Tempered Chocolate
Chocolate needs to be tempered since it has 6 forms and the most favourable one is Form V mixed with traces of Form IV. Each form is dependent on what temperature currently the chocolate is at with all 6 forms being within a less than 15&deg; band making the whole process frustrating.

### OP Radio
The most powerful commercial radio station ever was WLW (700KHz AM), which during certain times in the 1930s broadcasted 500kW radiated power. At night, it covered half the globe. Neighbors within the vicinity of the transmitter heard the audio in their pots, pans, and mattresses.

### Tarzan was first with muscles
Because Tarzan wears only a loincloth, the Disney animators working on the character had to study animal and human musculature to animate him, making him the first Disney character to actually be animated with working muscles.

### How to stop the british
When nazis invaded Greece, the staff of the Archaeological Museum in Athens buried all statues and artifacts in concrete fortified trenches stretching from the basement. The nazis found an empty museum. No one gave away the secret.
