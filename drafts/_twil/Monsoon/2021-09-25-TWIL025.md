## Imaginary Particles
### Preons
Preons are point particles, conceived of as sub-components of quarks and leptons. Interest in preon models peaked in the 1980s but has slowed, as the Standard Model of particle physics continues to describe the physics, mostly successfully, and no direct experimental evidence for lepton and quark compositeness has been found. Preons come in four varieties, plus, anti-plus, zero and anti-zero. W bosons have 6 preons and quarks have only 3.

When the term "preon" was coined, it was primarily to explain the two families of spin-½ fermions: quarks and leptons. More recent preon models also account for spin-1 bosons, and are still called "preons". Each of the preon models postulates a set of fewer fundamental particles than those of the Standard Model, together with the rules governing how those fundamental particles combine and interact. Based on these rules, the preon models try to explain the Standard Model, often predicting small discrepancies with this model and generating new particles and certain phenomena, which do not belong to the Standard Model.

### Axions
The axion is a particle postulated by the Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

Despite not yet having been found, axion models have been well studied for over 40 years, giving time for physicists to develop insight into axion effects that might be detected. Several experimental searches for axions are presently underway; most exploit axions' expected slight interaction with photons in strong magnetic fields. Axions are also one of the few remaining plausible candidates for dark matter particles, and might be discovered in some dark matter experiments.

### Tachyons
A tachyon is hypothetical particle that always travels faster than light. Most physicists believe that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics. Tachyons would also exhibit the unusual property of increasing in speed as their energy decreases, and would require infinite energy to slow down to the speed of light. No experimental evidence for the existence of such particles has been found.

In the 1967 paper that coined the term, Gerald Feinberg proposed that tachyonic particles could be made from excitations of a quantum field with imaginary mass. However, it was soon realized that Feinberg's model did not in fact allow for superluminal (FTL) speeds.In modern physics the term tachyon often refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to FTL particles. Such fields have come to play a significant role in modern physics.

A tachyonic field is a quantum field with an imaginary mass. Under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate FTL in such theories—the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality). While the field may have imaginary mass, any physical particles do not; the "imaginary mass" shows that the system becomes unstable, and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation (closely related to second order phase transitions) that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics


# MAIN STORIES
### Longest River
The longest river may either be the Nile or Amazon both of which is disputed. Since they are so close to each other in terms of length and have very varying shapes, a different base length will change which river is longer. Ex If a foot is used then Nile will be longer, if meter is used then amazon and so on. Due to fractal nature the true length when measured to atomic accuracy is infinite.

### EUROPE IS MAKING A COMEBACK IN LEGENDARY CARS
VW bought a small share of Rimac which they use to get the tech and benefit for Porsche and effectively split Rimac into Rimac Cars and Rimac Tech (research division). Porsche used this therefore to make Tycan in exchange for which they sold Rimac them Bugatti. Now Rimac Nevera is the fastest car on the planet. No caveats.c

### RAS syndrome
(where "RAS" stands for "redundant acronym syndrome", making the phrase "RAS syndrome" homological) is the use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym (or other initialism) in conjunction with the abbreviated form. This means, in effect, repeating one or more words from the acronym. Three common examples are "PIN number" / "VIN number" (the "N" in PIN and VIN stands for "number") and "ATM machine" (the "M" in ATM stands for "machine").

### Majorana Hypothesis
The primordial Matter-AntiMatter Imalance. They are hypothesising that there was double beta decay (vvvv rare) because which released 2 Majorana particles which self annihilated leaving behind only the matter parts. Majorana particles behave like they are matter anti-matter at the same time and can self Annihilate.
