## *Iceland & Climate*
Over the years Iceland has used its strategic position between China & USA in the sea to pressure NATO into allowing it to extend its Exclusive Economic Zone much further out.

Since Iceland's economy is heavily dependent on fishing (25-30%) the local fish habitat has been reduced a lot as a consequence of which the Govt has introduced Individual Transferable Quotas which impose restrictions on fishing by species.

Due to global warming iceland is losing its glaciers (they even held a funeral for their first completely melted glacier). They are building a new port to take advantage of a new northern sea route which will open up due to melting of ice.

## *Djibouti*
Japan's first and only military base since WW2 is in Djibouti. This probably because Japanese constitution prevents them from having a military other than for self defence.

Somalia Just to it's south is currently under Civil war with Al-Shabab against the Federal Govt. About half of the country also wants independence to be recognized as somaliland.

![BabElMandeb](https://i.imgur.com/f2prSIH.png)

Djibouti is located right on the Bab-al Mendeb Straight which is the world's most pirated area, part of reason to why there are so many military bases in Djibouti (Mostly NATO countries). This is the only way to access EU from Indian ocean without going all the way around.

Recently china also made their first foreign naval base in Djibouti. This is messing with the americans lol.

## *South China Sea*
![Trade](https://i.imgur.com/gmtUHqQ.png)
12% of the world's fish catch comes from this area, which is about 50% of the world's fishing vessels. Further below there are reserves of Natural Gas & Oil

![ChineseClaim](https://i.imgur.com/sVvWDhO.png)
China has started making claims in the Spratly Islands and heavily militarizing them. There was an International Tribunal (2016 Hague) which rules that the Spartly Islands are rocks and not islands and hence do not benefit as EEZs. It stated that china's claims were illegitimate. China does not accept this ruling.

US Interests are primarily shipping and interfering with things that are none of their business

## *Nile*

**Geography**
The White Nile is usually considered the source stream and is the longer of the two. The Blue Nile while not so actually provides a larger amount of water to the river. Both meet in Sudan.

South Sudan is currently under Civil War for leadership where about 0.5M people have been killed.

There are two dams, the Aswan High & Low dams which store water for the low tide periods. To create these dams several temples and ancient temples were completely dismantled and reassembled safe from water.

**Dependence**
Most of the countries use it for Agriculture.

![WaterAvailability](https://i.imgur.com/bHuPWcI.png)

Egypt rain is 60-80% Blue Nile Water. Most of the country (98% people) lives on 3% of the land area largly surrounding the river (2/3rd just in the Delta), since the river is the only source of fresh water in the entire country (90% land is desert)

![Populations](https://i.imgur.com/DAEbiyX.png)

Egypt plans to build (since the 70s) a second path for the river which they can route through 3 oases. As of today only less than tha first part of this is made.

Ethiopia is now building a new dam attached to a hydroelectric power station on the Ethiopia-Sudan border which would double Africa's electricity production and form the largest reservoir of water. This will take 10-15 years to fill.

**Politics**
The 2019 Peace prize winner & current PM of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed is claiming that this power station will not damage Egypt's water supply.

## *Syrian War (AS OF 2016)*
Damascus is the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet.
- **Red**: Syrian Govt i.e Bashar Al Assad. Russia Backed.
- **Green**: Opposition: USA Backed & Supplied(military equipment & CIA Training).
- **IS**: Islamic State (Terrorist Org, stemmed from Al-Qaueda), rule from Al-Raqqa
- **Yellow**: Kurdish Rojava, largely autonomous, progressive laws of equality & secularism.
![Syria Split](https://i.imgur.com/4hPhOSu.png)

Syria Turkey relations have also been poor due to conflicts on dams on Euphrates river.

- \>7M Displaced
- ~5M Refugees
- 0.5M Dead

This war is a human rights catastrophe


# MAIN STORIES
### Hercules
C130 is the heaviest aircraft to have ever landed on an Aircraft carrier it has held the rec for about 50 yrs of the 66 it has been in service. Very OP plane. Among the first to use Single Shaft TurboProp engines. This plane is every thing except a fighter (bomber, transport, Recon etc etc). It even had a Surface-To-Air Recovery System which was later discontinued due to soldier accident.

![C130](https://i.imgur.com/3MIWBdh.jpg)

It is safe AF. 1 crash in last 40 years. It can fly on just 1 of its 4 engines. It can take off on a distance 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of a standard 737. Created by Lockheed martin it has been used in Wars, Coast Guards, Deliveries, to land on Snow and much more.

### Daylight saving is useless
We used to save daylight in times where there was no electricity. We now have electricity. So what's the point bro. At the equator it is always 12-12. In NYC it is around 16-8. The poles have it 24-0. So a one hour shift is meaningless in any case.

### Shakespeare can't be french
French does not have lexical stresses all stress is on the last syllable by default. This also makes it impossible to have limericks in french.

### JPL Parachutes
The parachute string is made of Technora. 1m of technora thickness of shoelaces can hold the entire of the Curiosity rover.

### Aging
As we grow older Telomeres start shortening, as a result when these protections disappear, cells and as a consequence we, start to die.
![Aging Signs](https://i.imgur.com/1r33GY8.png)

Scientists are using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Where they cycle through excess oxygen and then bring back to normal values in cycles, in a high pressure chamber. The body sees this as hypoxia and regenerates stem cells. The telomeres' lengths increased by up to 20%. (*Aviv Scientific*)

### ML Hardware
The core of ML is a MAC (Multiply Accumulate func). A &larr; A + (B x C). Even something as small as mobilenet needs 550M+ MAC operations to make a single inference. The cycle of fetching the data to ALU takes much longer & power to calculate the data itself (O(1):O($$10^2$$)). So we need Multiple ALUs which can store more data. Enter GPUs.

Problem is GPUs use 32/64 bit floating point. Which is over-processing for ML use cases. We need at max 8B integer. This is ideal for CNNs. Google TPU is one such ex. Analog machine learning currently faces two problems, latency and accuracy. Data conversion takes time & heat and noise may change the result.

### Adjuvants
In immunology, an adjuvant is a substance that increases and/or modulates the immune response to a vaccine. Several of HepB vaccines have been using Aluminum as a vaccine since 1930s. In general there are many known adjuvants in widespread use, including Aluminum salts, oils and virosomes.

### Ramachandran Plot
In biochemistry, a Ramachandran plot (also known as a Rama plot, a Ramachandran diagram or a [φ,ψ] plot), originally developed in 1963 by G. N. Ramachandran is a way to visualize Protein Folding.

### Rotman Lens
Rotman lens allows radar systems to simultaneously see targets in multiple directions (multi-beam capability) without physically moving the antenna system. This lens is now integrated into many radars and EW systems around the world.

Scientists are considering using this in combination with the 5G grid to power devices such that the grid can deliver several µW of power per device. [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79500-x)

### Jupiter
Taylor–Proudman theorem (after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and Joseph Proudman) states that when a solid body[clarification needed] is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high angular velocity Ω, the fluid velocity will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. Ω must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the Coriolis force large compared to the acceleration terms.

### Storing Anti Matter
Anti matter is stored in an electro-magnetic field bathtub to prevent it from touching the walls and annihilating. This is a type of Penning–Malmberg Trap. As of 2017 we had made only a total of 10ng ever.
![StoringAntiMatter](https://i.imgur.com/mD0gPBZ.png)

### Parkinson's
Scientists are using Glial cells and converting them into neurons to cure parkinson's. We also know that glial cells are reliably reproduced throughout adulthood. These glial cells also can produce dopamine and therefore cure parkinson's. Live mice show promising results. Scientists are also converting carcinoma cells into neurons. Cancer into intelligence bruh.

# ANALYSIS

### Neutrino Detection
When a neutrino hits the detection medium (usually water) it releases an electron or a muon which in turn releases cherenkov radiation and that is detected by detectors.

### Trusses
Trusses are made out of triangles since 3 fixed lengths is a stable structure and no angles can be changed.

### Aliens
We are not afraid of aliens coming and enslaving us based on any data but the fact that we do that to ourselves. Every time any civilization has had visitors. It has not gone well for them

> We have science because our sensory system is extremely poor.

> If the earth rotates faster, coriolis force increases. So storms rotate faster. Jupiter is larger and rotates 2x Earth. **Just Imagine**

> Since we also move ahead as we rotate. Sun takes >24hrs to return to its position & stars take <24 hrs to return to their position. (About 1&deg; or about 4 mins)

### Treatments
We used to treat first by eating humans (ancient times). Then we treated by animals and then their parts (Mice, Bubonic Plague | Cows, Small Pox). Now we use bacteria & viruses. Based on the trend-line these probably will go away too in favour of chemicals & other molecular treatments.
