## *Bell X-15*
The bell X-1 had 4 separate engines which would ignite selectively at different temperatures. The X-15 could not do this, it was to be the fastest aircraft ever created (6.7Mach).

Bell X-15 which had to deal with temperatures much higher than even the SR-71 was made out of Inconel. SR-71 had peak surface temperatures of 400&deg;C. X-15 had to do 1000. So it was made of Ni + Cr + Fe + Nb = Inconel X. This was FAAAR more resistant to extreme temperatures but about 2x heavier.

Robert White pilot of X-15 was the first person ever to fly an airplane to space. William Knight also with X-15 still holds 6.7Mach record for highest speed every on an aircraft.

### Breaching BBB
Scientists have found ways to make nanobots that can breach the Blood-Brain Barrier. They use EColi to construct the bot and Rotating Magnetic fields to move it around such that it then accumulates in brain. [*ScienceRobotics*](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/52/eaaz9519)

### Timing F1
Transponders on F1 cars allow them to be tracked to within a ten thousandth of a second by transmitting radio waves. Timing loops are set about 1 cm into the F1 track, built out of lengths of wire that run across the width of the track and back protected in silicone. They’re spaced out every 150-200 m along the track, every time a car passes over it registers with the car’s transponder, transmitting a unique ID to a decoder that logs the time of day.

### Lab Testing
Mice are the ideal candidates for lab testing because it is possible to order up mice identical to each other or some other mouse elsewhere because of its sequences. We can control exact mutations also

### Laser Audio
Lasers can be pointed to a window at a distance. The reflection of this laser can then be used to see what the pattern is. Audio & any other sound causes micro vibrations in glass which can be then converted to waveform.

### VLBI
Scientists are using Very Long Base Interferometry to calculate the motion of the tectonic plates and the rotation of earth. Quasars very far away act like point sources of light and can be used to track subtle changes in the distance between two observatories and therefore the plates below.

### Kuramoto
Synchronizations of clocks first observed by Christian Huygens in 2 pendulum clocks (also invented by him for ships) hung from the same pole. The model used to calculate the motion of these pendulums on mapped onto a circle is called Kuramoto model. It uses the own frequency and also distance from other vectors on the circle to calculate the the motion

### Horizontal Gene Transfer
WHiteflies have shown a gene which neutralizes Phynolic Glycosides a series of toxins which the plants produce to keep insects away. This gene is believed to have been stolen from planets itself long ago. This could probably be the earliest known case of horizontal gene transfer.

> Institutional legacy is for those who live in the luminosity of the ones before them who have achieved something. It is for those with nothing of their own ~ NDT

> Voyager2 was actually sent 16 days before V1. V1 just took a shorter path and hence passed V2.
