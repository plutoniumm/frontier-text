# PRIME STORIES
## Virus Dead or Alive?
Assigning a fixed definition to what is dead or alive is very difficult
Considering virus is dead or alive is a matter of definition. If we define something then it is possible that there are some things which are also more alive than viruses get excluded Ex. certain bacteria at times turn dormant and become spores they do not grow or divide until the wake up but yet these bacteria are not considered dead. Wolbachia found inside the cells of many insects, these bacteria cannot survive for a very long on their own just like viruses.

If we try to say that the distinction is for those people who possess genetic machinery to redefine their code then also we run into a problem there are some viruses like mimivirus these were initially thought to be bacteria because they were so large that they could be seen with the regular microscope, these have 900+ gene pairs much more than the previously thought 200ish. Neither Mimivirus nor Wolbachia can reproduce on their own.

And what about Mitochondria which have their own DNA and make their own energy. These came into being because some other bacteria set up shop in a cell, not very different from the aforementioned Wolbachia. There are further complications due to the existence of Viroids, Retro Viruses, Selfish Genomes etc.

## Hammerhead Sharks
Humans have 2 overlapping eyes each with a binocular vision of 95&deg; and therefore a total field of 190&deg;, of this 120&deg; is an overlap for 3D vision. Most predators have eyes which can give them 3D vision. Most prey animals have eyes on their sides so that they are aware of danger coming from any direction. Hammerhead sharks have an almost full 360&deg; vision.

Hammerhead sharks are like airfoils but analysis shows that instead of adding to drag it helps them rapidly ascend and descend when the angle of attack is changed. This is much more efficient when hunting bottom dwelling prey as against to conventional sharks which engage in long pursuits.

Sharks use their electro sensory pores to hunt, as it works even in turbulence, darkness and under the sand. Most animals have muscles which generate small currents as they move, and salt water is a very good conductor of electricity. Since hammerhead sharks have much larger heads and much larger area, they use more pores to boost their ability to hunt. These sharks can detect less than 1nV/sq cm as they move their heads closed to the sand like a compass. This means when a small conventional battery with the poles at mumbai and chennai turns on, in theory the sharks will know.

Sharks are one of the few species to have survived all 5 mass extinctions so far.

# MAIN STORIES
### T-Rex
Computational Stress simulation on its bones has found that while the previous wide ranging estimates said that it could run 18-70Km/h, if it exceeded any more than 30Km/h T-Rex bones will fracture under stress. So it is likely that they were limited to fast walks as opposed to running. Currently there is a BIG. BIG debate on if TRex had scales or feathers, both schools have reasonably strong arguments.

### Errors 787
Boeing 787s must be turned off and on every 51 days to prevent 'misleading data' being shown to pilots.

### Smelly Fish
Fish that live deeper in water contain more TriMethylAmineOxide TMAO
The fish use this to stabilize proteins at more and more depths. When a fish is killed and taken out of water this TMAO is converted to TMA because of air. This is the distinctive fish smell. So fresh water fish donâ€™t smell as much as deep sea fish

### Black Belt
At one time a lot of US was under water and there lived large amounts of Krill. These Krill when water dried up formed large chalk walls which later dried up and formed EXTREMELY fertile soil. When the Europeans reached America and discovered that this soil could be used for optimum crop yields of cotton.

They started shipping slaves to this whole region called the black belt to work on the fields. To date this region has the maximum concentration of black residents nationally despite major migrations.

### Azerbaijan War
Last year unseen due to Covid, Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over a small region which has been disputed since the Russian Empire. There were multiple 3rd Party attempts to make peace with no success. Azerbaijan since the last ceasefire has brought advanced weaponry far better than Armenia and also have more people. In the final peace treaty they won back all the land.

This region is of interest to countries all around due to its strategic position as being the crossroads of multiple regions. It has changed hands for occupation over major empires over time. This time also the war was largely a proxy war with multiple parties with smaller conflicts playing a role.

### Growing Wood
When late devonian period saw a decline in the amount of atmospheric CO2, the plants started keeping stomata open for longer, this caused more water to lose out. In a convergent evolutionary form most plant species developed wood, this helped them have stronger roots and also conserve water as just one Xylem bundle was far less efficient. This mass evolution cause the amount of CO2 to rapidly go down, cause a mass extinction event and make the world we today live in.
