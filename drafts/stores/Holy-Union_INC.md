The Holy union matrimony


Jordan Peterson

Couples need to spend a minimum of 90 minutes per week AND additionally do at least one date (2 is better) per week to keep a stable marriage going.


People now are getting divorced more because it is easier to find a partner. Since thing like online and speed dating have made it easier to find a partner. Since the relationship is more superficial the mariage is also more unstable. This combined with the though _oh I can get a new partner very easily_ causes people to break of marriages very easily.
