The Netherlands is probably among the top 5 most successful countries on the planet. As one of the largest European colonizers then the Spanish Empire had a LOT of colonies, one of which even was Netherlands. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was what eventually transformed Netherlands from a swampy backwater to one of the largest empires on earth and now still one of the most successful countries.

(as of 2022) The VOC at its peak would in today's money be worth 7.9T$, easily more valuable than the GDP of every other country other than USA & China. Being a trillion dollar company is a luxury not many have aside from say Apple, Aramco and a couple here and there who frequent the list. Amazon recently even getting into the list of the first company to LOOSE 1T$ of valuation.

## The Starting of Trade
The Dutch independence effort ran into a big problem very early on. As seafaring people fishing and mercantile shipping was their thing. The main goods they shipped were spices coming from the Far East, much before the Dutch had any colonies of their own. Back then, Portugal held a virtual monopoly on the spice trade, all the way to Asia. Thus, what the Dutch did was to buy all their spices from Lisbon and then ship them around Europe for a profit.

But Portugal was absorbed into the Spanish Empire in 1580 and the first thing the Spanish did was to close off Lisbon to the Dutch merchants. Suddenly, the main artery of the Dutch economy had been cut off and the dutch were then forced to make their own network for which they sailed Far East beyond India. This effort was very decentralized. Merchants from various Dutch cities would establish companies for single voyages.

Since the job itself was very dangerous with 1/10th of the ships returning, out of 100s, and over that less than 1/3rd of the crews returning. The Dutch decided to spread out the risk. They consolidated most of their largest companies into one massive United East (& West) India Company (as it was then called) in 1602, this not only allowed them to absorb a lot of damage but also allowed the whole country as a whole to compete at that time with other empires such as Spanish and British.

The Dutch needed a new economic engine to fight off the Spanish and to restore their war-torn country. The VOC was their only hope, so to ensure maximum success they needed Vertical Integration (think Apple or Tesla), which is why it was granted
- Monopoly on trade
- Permission to train its own army
- Permission to occupy land
- Power to negotiate and declare war
- Enforce Slavery

But to do all this the VOC needed behemoth amounts of capital. So they crowd sourced it. In the center of Amsterdam, the VOC built a trading house, where every Dutch citizen could go and buy shares of the company, effectively giving the VOC money now in exchange for a claim on its profits in the future (dividend) but at the same time allowing the company to spread out its own risk, so that it doesn't have to take each loss of ship on the chin.

The VOC had unknowingly invented the first stock market becoming the first publicly traded company: *stock then merely meant the framework in which a boat is constructed*. Pretty much every rich man and some immigrants in the Netherlands invested in the VOC. In total, the VOC's IPO raised &gt;6M guilders, which is equivalent to about 110M$ today while being half-occupied by Spain (who basically let the Dutch take the risk and then just taxed the gains) and whose economy had been in the drain for a decade.

> Mercantilism the precursor to the Dutch created capitalism believed the world was a 0 sum game and he who controlled the gold controlled the world. (side note: Gold was money so the Germanic word for Money is also Geld), so they didn't really mean gold specifically but money in general

Taking Advantage of the Anglo-Spanish war the VOC entered Far East Asia and kicked out the portuguese, setting up their first base in Indonesia from Java island in 1611 from where they could go further east. They slaughtered the locals and built vast plantations. They used India and China to produce silk and fabrics which they could then trade to Japan for silver. The VOC used their vast profit margins sometimes as high as 1500% to funnel all the money back to the Netherlands and CREATE NEW LAND

## Terraforming & Valuation
Since Netherlands was a low lying (below sea level) country looking at their evolution over time we can clearly see how they built a series of dams and dykes and pumped out the water to create new land. (considering their yearly appreciation was 40%, which is absolutely staggering). They even discovered two new land masses south of the equator which they decided to call New Holland (now Australia) and New Zeeland (now with a diff spelling). Even Cape Town started as a Dutch resting post therefore giving their local language Afrikaans its Dutch roots.

While around 1637 its Market Cap was 78M Guilders, inflation doesn't automatically value it at 7.4T$ today. Let do it in gold, 78M guilders at the then exchange rate would be 47 tonnes of gold. In today's money (2022) that is basically 2.4B$ a mere 0.03% of the 7.4T$. In all fairness gold then was around 20,000 tonnes as opposed to today around 119,000 tonnes making gold far more valuable then. Even adjusting for supply constraints that figure comes to around 22B$. VALUATION IS HARD. The US today aims for a 1-2% inflation and 2-3% growth so that growth just barely outpaces inflation.

The 1600s however weren't like today they were very poor. By GDP they were just 81B dollars WORLD AGGREGATE. Something probably a few states of just the US can outmatch. The average US citizen today lives better than some of the kings of 300 years ago simply because we live in wealthier times. So in order to do a fair comparison lets do an Assets - Liabilities calculation.

At its peak the company had around 40 warships, 150 merchant ships plus around a dozen ports and 100,000 acres of plantations as well as a large inventory of spices. So that last one is probably the easiest to get rid of. Nutmeg then was worth as much as gold. Today it costs peanuts. Even the full fleet of their ships by today's standards can be rebuilt in 10M$ while being generous since they were basically wooden tubs with no engines. Their land and gold however would be their most prized asset which also has a caveat. Most of this land was in Asia, which is worth nothing today, so the total book value would come to around 30B$.

This however is just the math. The 7.4T$ number used frequently is less a matter of just valuation but also that of influence. Back then the VOC owned a significant portion of world GDP, so that is much more power than just appreciable value.

## End
Just like the bulk of apple's money comes from iPhones, the bulk of VOC's wealth came from Tulips. Tulips were first introduced to Amsterdam from Turkey in 1554. They were immediately seen as good which every garden sought to have. What made it harder was that they needed 7-12 months of careful attention to grow even after which they bloom for around a week.

This exotic exclusivity made Tulips a status symbol and enough to become its own financial bubble in the 1550s and 60s. Since tulips took time to bloom the prices for them were actually set in the future. This was also the first derivatives/futures market that there was. Its easy to see how the rest of this was a bubble since ultimately Mortgage Credit Default Swaps or Tulips are both vulnerable to greed and speculation. At one point while being traded even in Paris & London on the London Stock Exchange a tulip bulb's price went up 20x in a month which was 10x the annual wage of a worker.

The Dutch govt immediately after the crash made changes to make sure this never happened again. Within a few years in the 18th Century however in the Anglo-Dutch wars in Asia and in the Franco-Dutch wars on home they very quickly lost most of VOC and the company was nationalized, and sunk. All its colonies became Dutch colonies.

It is important to note that growth of business was not just a matter of luck but cultural. Dutch companies could borrow at 4% annual debt interest rate compared to then 10% England and 25% credit cards today. Effectively letting the dutch do 2.5x as much as the english. This was further built on top of the already established system of bonds which the dutch used to use to fuel the famous land reclamation projects to build fields and grow tulips on them. Life comes full circle

The dutch also pioneered Fractional shares so that more and more people could get in on their action and therefore also fuel it. The 1700s overall fueled their culture heavily like Rembrandt and Vemeer and the classic coloured houses by the water representative of Netherlands today all on the success of the VOC.

The british would then copy paste this Extreme Money making, centralized Iron Fist rule style form of extreme capitalism and go on to rule half of the world with their version of it.
